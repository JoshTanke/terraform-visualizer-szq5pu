# Security Measures

## Authentication

- Implementation: Auth0 integration with RBAC
- Features:
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Single sign-on (SSO)
  - Role-based access control
  - Session management
  - Audit logging

## Data Protection

- Encryption at rest using AWS KMS
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Data classification levels:
  - Critical: Authentication credentials, API keys
  - High: Terraform configurations, infrastructure state
  - Medium: User preferences, visualization data
  - Low: Public documentation, public metadata

## Infrastructure Security

- AWS WAF protection with custom rule sets
- Network security:
  - VPC isolation
  - Security groups
  - Network ACLs
- Infrastructure hardening:
  - Regular security patches
  - Immutable infrastructure
  - Least privilege access
